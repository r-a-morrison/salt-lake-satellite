Cleaned data sets as well as any other processed data. This directory houses all small (< 50 MB) data sets. This is not a place to store all of your large (> 50 MB) data files, such as images. For accessibility of these large data sets, there are myriad online data repositories such as Zenodo which provide free storage and DOI generation. In addition, you should have all of your data backed up locally with redundancy.
